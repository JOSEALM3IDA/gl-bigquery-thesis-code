-- NOTE: When analyzing complex SQL queries, I start with understanding the subqueries. Otherwise, they will be harder to understand.
-- This is reflected in the comments I've written - if they're read in another order, they might not make much sense.

    The solution found was to "transpose" these values, inserting all the different values for each period into multiple columns of the same entry.
    These different values per period are promptly available when they need to be used together.
    In this first step, the values are not yet transposed, but are split in different columns, writing zeros when the values don't refer to that specific period.
    These columns can later be summed together, obtaining the desired table. */
